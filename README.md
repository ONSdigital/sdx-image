# sdx-image

The sdx-image microservice is a bespoke app used within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to aid with  
Survey Data eXchange (SDX). It provides functionality to transform a JSON survey response into a JPEG image.
This allows users downstream to process submissions collected through EQs (Electronic Questionnaires) with the same
set of tools as if the submission had been received in paper form.
